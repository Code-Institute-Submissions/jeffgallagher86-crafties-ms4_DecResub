## Other Testing

* I ran the [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) command in the terminal to review the javascript code and corrected where possible.

* I ran the [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) command in the terminal to review the python code and corrected where possible to clean the code and make it Pep8 compliant.
